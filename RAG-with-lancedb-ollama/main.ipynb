    "# Building a Banking Customer Service Chatbot with LanceDB and Ollama\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are building a customer service chatbot for banking using LanceDB and Ollama. The chatbot is designed to provide efficient and professional responses to customer inquiries.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the **Bitext Retail Banking LLM Chatbot Training Dataset** from Hugging Face to train and set up a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This dataset contains instructions, intents, responses, and other relevant fields to help the chatbot understand and respond to user queries effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow includes:\n",
    "1. Loading the Bitext dataset.\n",
    "2. Embedding the data using Ollama's embedding model.\n",
    "3. Storing the data in LanceDB with a defined schema.\n",
    "4. Setting up a RAG pipeline to retrieve relevant context for user queries.\n",
    "5. Using the retrieved context to generate accurate and empathetic responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures the chatbot is both contextually aware and capable of handling a wide range of banking-related queries."
