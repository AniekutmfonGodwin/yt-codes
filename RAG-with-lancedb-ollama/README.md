# Building a Banking Customer Service Chatbot with LanceDB and Ollama

Efficient and professional customer service is critical in banking. This project demonstrates how to build a customer service chatbot using LanceDB and Ollama, leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to provide accurate and empathetic responses to customer inquiries.

## 💡 How It Works
The chatbot is trained using the [**Bitext Retail Banking LLM Chatbot Training Dataset**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bitext/Bitext-retail-banking-llm-chatbot-training-dataset) from Hugging Face, which includes fields like:
- **Tags**: Categorizing issues (e.g., “account opening,” “loan inquiries”).
- **Instruction**: User queries such as “How do I reset my PIN?”
- **Category**: Grouping by issue type (e.g., accounts, loans, security).
- **Intent**: Understanding user needs (e.g., troubleshooting vs. information).
- **Response**: AI-generated, contextually relevant answers.

The workflow involves:
1. Loading the Bitext dataset.
2. Embedding the data using Ollama's embedding model.
3. Storing the data in LanceDB with a defined schema.
4. Setting up a RAG pipeline to retrieve relevant context for user queries.
5. Using the retrieved context to generate accurate and empathetic responses.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **LanceDB**: For vector-based retrieval of banking-related data.
- **Hugging Face**: To classify queries and fine-tune response accuracy.
- **Ollama**: For real-time, on-device LLM inference with reduced latency.

## 🚀 Why This Matters
Banking customers expect fast, accurate, and empathetic support. By grounding chatbot responses in retrieved knowledge, this system minimizes errors and improves customer satisfaction—reducing the need for manual intervention.

## 💭 Next Steps
- Expanding the knowledge base with real-time banking regulation updates.
- Optimizing retrieval for multilingual support.
- Fine-tuning AI responses to enhance conversational tone and professionalism.
